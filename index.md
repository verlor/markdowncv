## :information_source: About

Mexico-based web developer with more than 7 years of experience. I am interested in delivering worth through fitting technology. Going from Java to **NodeJs** and some **TypeScript** in between, I consider myself a pragmatic programmer, capable of using the right tool for the job. My strongest stack at the moment is **React JS**, but I enjoy learning new technologies/languages and the last *blazingly fast* framework.
